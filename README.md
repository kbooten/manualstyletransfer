# Manual Style Transfer

Style Transfer is a computational task in which the style of one author or discourse is projected onto a text.

Manual Style Transfer is an interface that directs the writer to manually transform a sentence to be (in this case) more Whitmanic. A classifier trained to distinguish between authors is used to judge Whitmanicity.  Word Mover's Distance (Kusner, 2015) is used to keep track of semantic distance from the original sentence.
